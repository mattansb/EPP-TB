## Version 3.1.3

| Function | Update | Notes |

|`epp_matchsubjects` | NEW | Use to remove subjects that are missing data in some conditions.|

|`epp_combineconds` | IMPROVEMENT | Supports combining conds based on REGEXP.|
|`epp_plotbutterfly` | IMPROVEMENT | The `trace` parameter replaces `all` parameter.|
|`epp_get*` | IMPROVEMENT | All `epp_get*` functions now export the identification column with the correct name (*ID*).|
|`epp_plot*` | IMPROVEMENT | All plot functions are faster and more efficiant when exporting plot data to `.csv`.|
|`f_WaveletConv`|FIX| When creating wavelets via `f_WaveletConv` (formerly `suppWaveletConv`), baseline correcting no-longer stops on error.|
|`epp_getTF` | FIX | Fixed bug in `epp_getTF` that caused error when conditions were not of equal size N.|
