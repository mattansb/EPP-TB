# EPP-TB: The ERP Post-Processing Tool Box <img src="doc\logo.png" align="right"/>

```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

Once completing pre-processing in eeglab/erplab/Net Station, you're ready to get to the fun stuff: plotting and measuring with EPP-TB!
This package is aimed at simple (readable), concise (one function per action) and reproducible code writing.
Additionally, a major component is the ability to export data and plots to be used and further manipulated elsewhere (say, `ggplot2`?).

All user-end functions start with `epp_*`.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To use EPP-TB you will need:

* Matlab (2015a+).
* [eeglab](https://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/index.php) (14.X.X) for importing `.set` files, and plotting topos.
* R  
    + [`tidyverse`](https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyverse) + [`purrr`](https://github.com/tidyverse/purrr).
    + [`scales`](https://github.com/hadley/scales) for plotting in R.
    + [`mgcv`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=mgcv) for plotting topo plots.

### Installing

Install the package [downloading](https://github.com/mattansb/EPP-TB/releases) and adding the EPP-TB folder (and sub-folders) to your Matlab paths.

## Importing Data into an EPP structure

Three import methods are currently supported:

- `epp_loadeeglab` - Import multiple `.set` files from eeglab (supports wavelet analysis based on [Mike X. Cohen's great book and code](http://www.mikexcohen.com/)).
- `epp_loaderplab` - Import from [erplab](http://www.erpinfo.org/erplab.html).
- `epp_loadegimat` - Import multiple `.mat` files exported from Net Station (EGI).

The resulting structure array has `length(struct)` equal to the number of conditions, and contains the following fields, per condition:

- **Condition**: the name of the conditions.
- **timeLine**: a vector of time points.
- **IDs**: a table with two variables - _**ID**_ and _**nTrials**_ (the number of trials a ERP has been averaged across).
- **Data**: a channels$\times$`length(timeLine)`$\times$`length(IDs)` matrix for ERP data.

If a wavelet analysis has been preformed, the Data field is replaced with:

- **Freqs**: a vector of frequencies used.
- **ersp** and **itc**: channels$\times$`length(Freqs)`$\times$`length(timeLine)`$\times$`length(IDs)` matrices.

### Data Reduction

These functions can be used to compute new conditions or manipulate existing data:

- Merge 2 or more conditions with `epp_combineconds`.
- Compute differences between 2 conditions with `epp_diffwave`.
- Compute LRP with `epp_LRP`
- Compute global field potentials with `epp_GFP`.



## Plotting

### ERP Plots

#### Grand averages
Grand averages can be plotted by specifying the conditions and channel indices (averaged across) to plot:

```Matlab
conds         = {'Control_Crr_plus','Control_L5_plus'};
channel_inds  = [5 6 11 12];
epp_plotgrands(study,conds,channel_inds)
```

```{r grand_plot}

grand_data <- read_csv("doc/grand_plot_data.csv") %>%    # load the data file
  as.tbl() %>% 
  mutate_at(.vars = c("Time","mean","sd"), .funs = as.numeric) %>% 
  mutate(Condition = as.factor(Condition),
         N  = as.integer(N),
         se = sd/sqrt(N))

grand_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Time, y = mean,
             color = Condition, fill = Condition,
             group = Condition)) + geom_vline(xintercept = 0) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +
  geom_line() + 
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +
  labs(x = "Time", y = expression(paste(mu,"V")))

```


You can also plot error envelopes:

```Matlab
epp_plotgrands(study,conds,channel_inds,'errorType','SE')
% can also be set to 'SD' or 'CIXX' 
% (with XX replaced with any percent: 'CI95','CI80', etc...).
```

```{r grand_plot_se}
grand_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Time, y = mean,
             color = Condition, fill = Condition,
             group = Condition)) + geom_vline(xintercept = 0) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = mean-se, ymax = mean+se),
              alpha = 0.25, color = NA) + 
  geom_line() + 
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +
  labs(x = "Time", y = expression(paste(mu,"V")))
```


#### Topo Plots

Topo plotting is dependent on eeglab functions. Additionally, you will need to provide a eeglab-like chanlocs structure to these functions, with `length(chanlocs)==size(study.Data,1)`.

```Matlab
times = [185];
epp_plottopo(study,chanlocs,conds,channel_inds,times)
```
```{r topo_plot}

raw.data <- read.csv("doc/topo_plot_data.csv") %>%
  as.tbl() %>% 
  mutate(Condition   = as.factor(Condition),
         # convert Theta and Radius to (x,y)
         radianTheta = pi/180*Theta,
         x           = Radius*sin(radianTheta),
         y           = Radius*cos(radianTheta),
         r           = sqrt(x^2 + y^2))

expand.topo <- function(data, gridRes = NULL) {
  library(mgcv)
  if (is.null(gridRes))
    gridRes <- data[[1]] %$% unique(Channel) %>% {length(.)/2}
  
  res <- list()
  for (c in 1:length(data)) {
    LL <- data[[c]]
    
    minx <- min(LL$x)*1.1
    miny <- min(LL$y)*1.1
    maxx <- max(LL$x)*1.1
    maxy <- max(LL$y)*1.1
    
    tmp.GAM <- expand.grid(x = seq(minx*1.05,maxx*1.05,length = gridRes),
                           y = seq(miny*1.05,maxy*1.05,length = gridRes)) %>%
      data.frame()
    
    tmp.GAM$Amp <- LL %>%
      gam(Amp ~ s(x, y, bs = 'ts'), data = .) %>% 
      predict(tmp.GAM, type = "response")
    res[[c]] <- tmp.GAM %>% 
      filter(sqrt(x^2 + y^2) <= max(diff(range(x)),diff(range(y)))/2)
    rm(tmp.GAM)
  }
  return(res)
}

circleFun <- function(diameter = 1, center = c(0,0), npoints = 100) {
  r  <- diameter / 2
  tt <- seq(0,2*pi,length.out = npoints)
  xx <- center[1] + r * cos(tt)
  yy <- center[2] + r * sin(tt)
  return(data.frame(x = xx, y = yy))
}

# Topo theme
theme_topo <- function(base_size = 12) {
  theme_bw(base_size = base_size) %+replace%
    theme(rect       = element_blank(),
          line       = element_blank(),
          axis.text  = element_blank(),
          axis.title = element_blank()
    )
}

chanlocs <- raw.data %>% 
  select(Channel, x, y) %>%
  distinct()

diam      <- chanlocs %$%
  max(diff(range(x)),diff(range(y))) # can be adjusted
head <- list()
head$shape <- circleFun(diam*0.75)
head$mask  <- circleFun(diam*1.15)
head$nose  <- data.frame(x = c(-.075,0,.075),
                         y = c(-.005,.075,-.005) + max(head$shape$y))

topo.data <- raw.data %>% 
  group_by(Condition,TimePnt) %>% 
  select(Condition,TimePnt,Channel,x,y,Amp) %>% 
  nest() %>%
  mutate(data = expand.topo(data)) %>% 
  unnest()

ggplot(topo.data,aes(x, y)) +
  ## The Topos
  geom_raster(aes(fill = Amp))+
  facet_grid(TimePnt~Condition) +
  ## The Head
  geom_path(data = head$mask, color = "white",size = 4) +
  geom_path(data = head$nose, size = 1.5) +
  geom_path(data = head$shape, size = 1.5) +
  ## The Channels
  geom_point(data = chanlocs) +
  ## Design
  scale_fill_distiller(palette = "RdYlBu", direction = -1,
                       limits = range(topo.data$Amp), oob = squish) +
  labs(fill = "Amplitude") +
  theme_topo() +
  coord_equal()

```

#### Butterfly and Trace Plots

Butterfly plots can be used to plot the mean ERP for each subject individually.

```Matlab
epp_plotbutterfly(study,conds,channel_inds)
```

```{r butterfly_plot}

butterfly_data <- read_csv("doc/butterfly_plot_data.csv") %>% # load the data file
  group_by(Condition,Time) %>% 
  mutate(meanAmp = mean(amp)) %>% 
  ungroup()

butterfly_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Time, y = amp,
             color = Condition,
             group = ID)) + 
  facet_wrap(~Condition) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) + 
  geom_line(alpha = 0.8) + 
  geom_line(aes(y = meanAmp), color = "black", size = 1) +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +  
  labs(x = "Time", y = expression(paste(mu,"V"))) 

```


Trace plots are similar to butterfly plots, but the mean activation (across subjects) is plotted for each channel separately.

```Matlab
epp_plotbutterfly(study,conds,channel_inds,'all',true)
% if channels are indicated, they are ignored.
```
```{r trace_plot}

trace_data <- read_csv("doc/trace_plot_data.csv")

trace_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Time, y = amp,
             color = Condition,
             group = ID)) + 
  facet_wrap(~Condition) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) + 
  geom_line(alpha = 0.8) + 
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) + 
  labs(x = "Time", y = expression(paste(mu,"V"))) 

```

### TF Plots

Time Frequency plots plot both ersp and itc:

```Matlab
epp_plotTF(study,conds,channel_inds)
```

```{r TFplot}

TF_data <- read_csv("doc/TFplot_data.csv")


# Plot --------------------------------------------------------------------

# Use geom_raster to plot y-axis scale as is
ersp <- ggplot(TF_data,aes(Time, Frequencies, fill = ersp)) + # or fill = itc
  geom_raster(interpolate = T) +
  facet_grid(.~Condition) +
  scale_y_log10(breaks = sort(unique(TF_data$Frequencies))[seq(1,50, by = 4)] %>% round()) + # if Frequencies are log-spaced
  scale_fill_distiller(palette = "OrRd", limits = c(-1,2), oob = squish)

itc <- ggplot(TF_data,aes(Time, Frequencies, fill = itc)) + # or fill = itc
  geom_raster(interpolate = T) +
  facet_grid(.~Condition) +
  scale_y_log10(breaks = sort(unique(TF_data$Frequencies))[seq(1,50, by = 4)] %>% round()) + # if Frequencies are log-spaced
  scale_fill_distiller(palette = "OrRd", oob = squish)


ersp / itc

```

Topo Plots-  is a wrapper around `epp_plottopo`.
Need to specify bands:

```Matlab
bands = [4, 8; 8, 12];
% a matrix of frequencies, with each row containing a range of frequencies
% to plot (1st column is lower limit, 2nd column is upper limit of band).
epp_plottopoTF(study,chanlocs,conds,channel_inds,times,bands)
```
```{r TFtopo}
raw.data <- read.csv("doc/TFtopo_data.csv") %>%
  as.tbl() %>% 
  mutate(Condition   = as.factor(Condition),
         # convert Theta and Radius to (x,y)
         radianTheta = pi/180*Theta,
         x           = Radius*sin(radianTheta),
         y           = Radius*cos(radianTheta),
         r           = sqrt(x^2 + y^2))
  

topo.data <- raw.data %>% 
  group_by(Condition,TimePnt) %>% 
  select(Condition,TimePnt,Channel,x,y,Amp) %>% 
  nest() %>%
  mutate(data = expand.topo(data)) %>% 
  unnest()# %>% 
  # separate(Condition, into = c("Group","Level","Oper","Freq")) %>% 
  # unite("Condition",Group:Oper)

ggplot(topo.data,aes(x, y)) +
  ## The Topos
  geom_raster(aes(fill = Amp))+
  facet_grid(TimePnt~Condition) +
  ## The Head
  geom_path(data = head$mask, color = "white",size = 4) +
  geom_path(data = head$nose, size = 1.5) +
  geom_path(data = head$shape, size = 1.5) +
  ## The Channels
  geom_point(data = chanlocs) +
  ## Design
  scale_fill_distiller(palette = "OrRd",
                       limits = c(-1,2), oob = squish) +
  labs(fill = "Amplitude") +
  theme_topo() +
  coord_equal()

```

### Exporting to R

All plots can be exported to R and plotted with [`ggplot2`](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2) by setting `'R',true` in any of the plotting function. This produces two time-stamped files: 

- A data file (`*_data.csv`)
- A code file (`*_code.R`), to plot said data using `ggplot2`.


## Measuring

Measuring can be done via the `epp_get*` functions. These are wrapper functions for the various `m_*` functions (with one functions per method), **which should not be called directly** (unless you know what you're doing).

Saving results always produces a 2-sheet `.xlsx` file, with the second sheet containing the parameters used in measuring - this is to insure reproducibility of results. Thus, if you have the output `.xlsx` file, you'll never find yourself asking "what was the time window we used last time?".

### ERP Amplitude

The function `epp_getAmp` implements the methods for measuring amplitudes described in chapter 9 of [Steven J. Luck's intro to ERP book](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-event-related-potential-technique-0).

 - (Local) Peak amplitude
 - Point amplitude
 - Mean amplitude
 - Integral
 - Area

_Please note that `epp_getamplitude` is no longer supported and should not be used._

### ERP Latency

The function `epp_getLat` implements the methods for measuring latencies described in chapter 9 of [Steven J. Luck's intro to ERP book](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-event-related-potential-technique-0), as well as those described in [Kiesel et al.'s Jakknife paper](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-8986.2007.00618.x/abstract).

- (Local) Peak latency
- Relative criterion
- Fractional area
- Baseline deviation
- Absolute criterion

_Please note that `epp_getlatency` is no longer supported and should not be used._

### TF Power

The function `epp_getTF` measure the *mean* ersp / itc from selected channels, within a specified time-window,separately for specified frequency bands (as shown above, for `epp_plottopoTF`).
