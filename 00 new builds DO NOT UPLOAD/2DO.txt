Bug: time smoothing doesn't work!
Instantaneous amplitude (if time window is of length 1, double it, find nearest sample, and measure 'mean')
eeglab import - from study?
add reliabilty test when possible?
bootstrap errors when plotting
wavlet - change time-resampling to just cutting + downsampling!
change output file names to use this: https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/tempname.html 


re-write wiki. focus on get vs plot + R
write README (in markdown?)
