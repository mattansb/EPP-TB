Bug: time smoothing doesn't work in epp_plottopo - use movmean
NEW: eeglab import - from set files - wavelet and ERP! (make pop function?)
NEW: combine conditions - data (ERP) / ITC / ERSP

IMRV: re-write wiki. focus on get vs plot + R
IMRV: write README (in markdown?)

Instantaneous amplitude (if time window is of length 1, double it, find nearest sample, and measure 'mean')
wavlet - change time-resampling to just cutting + downsampling!
bootstrap errors when plotting
add reliabilty test when possible?

change output file names to use this: https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/tempname.html
